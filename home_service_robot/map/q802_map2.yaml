# origin is relative to the lower-left pixel, hence -x, -y here
# origin: [-16.15, -9.97, 0.0]
# However, the map is not a simple rectangle, plus there is free/white
# space (in pixels) around the outside, hence this origin is hand-tuned
# by observing where the laser scans hit w.r.t the 2D map and gazebo.
